# AHN preprocessing. 
This python code is used to process AHN height data from a 3d point cloud to a geospatial vector data format (.shp or .tif) for GIS applications and Machine Learning algorithms.

See the ahn_preprocessing_spark.py for the code.

For more information about AHN data go to this link [link](https://www.ahn.nl/)

Our implementation uses PySpark to do most of it's calculations, so it can only be run a spark environment like Databricks.

The following figure exemplifies the process:
