# AHN preprocessing. 
This python code is used to process AHN height data from a 3d point cloud to a geospatial vector data format (.shp) for GIS applications and Machine Learning algorithms.

Our implementation uses PySpark to do most of it's calculations, so it can only be run a spark environment like Databricks.

The following figure exemplifies the process:
